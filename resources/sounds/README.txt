Sound files need to be in WAV format for Raylib.

For a complete implementation, you would need to create or obtain the following sound files:
- diamond_collect.wav - Sound when collecting a diamond
- jump.wav - Sound when player jumps
- level_complete.wav - Sound when completing a level
- hurt.wav - Sound when player takes damage

These can be created using audio tools or obtained from free sound libraries.
